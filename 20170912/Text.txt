Alta is the largest city in the northeast of Norway. Best known for being a great spot to view the Northern Lights, the city also has a number of other attractions. Popular winter activities include dog sledding, snowmobile riding and skiing. During the summer months, many people travel to Alta in order to hike the mountains or to view the prehistoric rock carvings located in and around the Alta museum. These carvings, which date back up to 7,000 years, cannot be seen during the winter as they are covered in snow.
