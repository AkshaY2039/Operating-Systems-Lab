Alta is the largest city in the northeast of Norway. Best known for being a great spot to view the Northern Lights, the city also has a number of other attractions. Popular winter activities include dog sledding, snowmobile riding and skiing. During the summer months, many people travel to Alta in order to hike the mountains or to view the prehistoric rock carvings located in and around the Alta museum. These carvings, which date back up to 7,000 years, cannot be seen during the winter as they are covered in snow.

Travelling to Alta is easy thanks to a number of direct flights between Alta and Oslo, the capital of Norway, as well as several other Norwegian cities. A network of buses also crosses the country. The geography of Norway means that ferries often offer the fastest route between cities. Driving in Norway can be extremely challenging during the winter and is probably best avoided by inexperienced drivers. If you do opt to drive, ensure you have allowed enough time to reach your destination as many travellers underestimate the time it takes to travel from one city to another. During the height of winter, key roads may be closed.

On average, the weather in Alta varies between a high of up to 17 degrees Celsius in summer and a low of minus 5 degrees Celsius in winter, though both hotter and colder temperatures have been recorded. The warmest months of the year are between July and September while the coldest fall between November and February. If you wish to view the Northern Lights, the best time to travel to Alta is between October and March. The dry climate in Alta means conditions for viewing the lights are often excellent, but skies are more likely to be clear from December onwards.
