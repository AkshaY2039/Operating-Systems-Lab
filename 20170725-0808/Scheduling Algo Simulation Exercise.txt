Write down a scheduler using OOPs and simulate the following shceduling algorithms:
1.	First Come First Serve
2.	Shortest Job First
3.	Shortest Remaining Time First/Next
4.	Round Robin
5.	Static Priority
6.	Dynamic Priority
7.	Highest Response Ratio

Use one of these simulations on Files as Processes where file size shall be counted as Service Time
